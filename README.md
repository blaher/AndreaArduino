Home automation bot/assistant. The purpose of this bot was to have a radar driven bot drive around the house, following me from room to room. Attached with a mic for speech recognition, that would then rely commands over a zwave bridge to instruct my zwave hub to carry out commands. However, I fulfilled this need with an Amazon Echo and will no longer be developing the bot.
